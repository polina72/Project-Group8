SUGO

Delivery app - The purpose of the App is to provide a platform where students of the same campus can connect with each, request or offer variety of services and thus, increase their accessibility and productivity, and save time. The platform will benefit students, local restaurants, and local stores.

Note: The project is down on Appy Pie. Because of this, the work will be done on the SUGO Appy Pie account and a link to the updated App will be provided along with its coresponding date. The team uses a single Appy Pie account and make changes directly on the website. SUGO App and Appy Pie email : sugoSJSU@gmail.com
